The goal of this project is to create an app that quizzes the user on Javascript elements. 

My first task is to figure out what palette to use for this project so that I can apply CSS. My second task is to start mapping out the HTML portion of this project in order to add Javascript to that framework. 

I started with a basic HTML format and began to plug in my code for the quiz app. 

I first had to map out the layout of my quiz. 

I started with building the html and placing the titles, questions, and answers where I wanted them to be.

I went into CSS to position the text elements on the webpage and apply colors to the text and background.

The colors chosen for the app are: 


Once I am able to apply the CSS to my HTML file then I can start applying Javascript in order to add a responsive element to my static html document.

My last task is to successfully have this app open on a local server successfully
