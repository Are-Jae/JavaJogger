## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

The goal of this project is to create an app that quizzes the user on Javascript elements. 

My first task is to figure out what palette to use for this project so that I can apply CSS. My second task is to start mapping out the HTML portion of this project in order to add Javascript to that framework. 

I started with a basic HTML format and began to plug in my code for the quiz app. 

I first had to map out the layout of my quiz. 

I started with building the html and placing the titles, questions, and answers where I wanted them to be.

I went into CSS to position the text elements on the webpage and apply colors to the text and background.

The colors chosen for the app are: (this has changed)

Text: Black
Buttons: Orange
Webpage Background: Off-white
Results Text: Green (applies to wins & losses)
Highscore Text: Blue (applies only to highscore and logged scores)
Timer Text:
Reset Text:

I decided to leave the buttons as their default color. 


Once I am able to apply the CSS to my HTML file then I can start applying Javascript in order to add a responsive element to my static html document.

I struggled with what to name my sections and containers to make sure I was making my code as reader friendly and efficient as possible. Once I was able to determine the best naming practices for those elements I focused on styling the text. I added color and positioning to text before I finished with the javascript in order to get a better idea of where my app would be located on the webpage. 

Then I am able to resume adding interactive elements to my app. 

I was able to add a multiple choice option to my webpage, now I need to figure out how to display the questions and subsequent answers in a more aesthetically pleasing way instead of a list. 

My last task is to successfully have this app open on a local server successfully
